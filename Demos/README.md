This folder contains backups of the demos we showed in different presentations.

The FAQin demo is a bit of a mess - we still hadn't managed to produce a fully functional build, so we patched it up manually using ext-storage. Flashing back then was done manually. It was kept here just for reference.

The Lacon demo is a truly fully functional one, and the one you probably want. Just flash it using the provided script and it will run.

Make sure to insert a blank ext4 formatted SD card when you boot it up, however. This demo won't work with standard SD cards.

The root password is "toor".
